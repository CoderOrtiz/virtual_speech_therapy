This is accomplished by donating all monthly Speak Up profits to these organizations. Recipient organizations are selected each month by Speak Up clients & their families. Clients and family members can "speak up for the poor & helpless" by casting their vote via the "VOTE" tab in the menu above. Anyone is welcome to donate directly through links to organizations' websites provided on the "DONATE" page.</h6>
      <h2 class="our_vision_quotes">"Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves; ensure justice for those being crushed. Yes, speak up for the poor and helpless, and see that they get justice."</h2>

      <!-- More About Emily -->
      <section class="more_about_emily">
      <h2>More about Emily...</h2>
      <p>Emily received both her undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Florida in Gainesville. She completed her clinical fellowship training at the Malcom-Randall VA Medical Center in Gainesville, Florida. After her fellowship she was hired on as full-time staff and continued to grow her clinical skills there from 2019-2021. In 2021, Emily decided it was time to pursue her career dream by starting her own private practice with a mission-minded vision. Thus, Speak Up Virtual Speech Therapy LLC was born! While building up her Speak Up clientele she works part-time at a number of skilled nursing and adult outpatient settings.</p>
      <p>Emily has years of experience in evaluating and treating individuals with communication and swallowing disorders. She also had the opportunity of providing virtual speech therapy services via the VA's telehealth platform during her time at the VA. With this experience, Emily is equipped to provide quality and convenient virtual speech therapy services. Of course, not everyone's needs will be able to be met entirely through virtual services and in those circumstances, Emily will ensure her clients receive  appropriate referrals to providers offering in-person services. </p>
      <p>Emily's expertise includes delivering speech, language, voice, cognitive, and swallowing teletherapy to individuals with a wide variety of etiologies including stroke, movement disorders, head and neck cancer, traumatic brain injury, other neurogenic etiologies, cardiopulmonary disease, and a variety of voice disorders such as presbyphonia (aging voice), muscle tension dysphonia, vocal cord paralysis, etc. </p>
      <p>As mentioned previously, Emily has a passion for working with individuals with Parkinson's Disease to improve and maintain their speaking abilities. Emily is a certified SPEAK OUT! provider through the Parkinson's Voice Project.  See more information about the SPEAK OUT! Program at https://www.parkinsonvoiceproject.org/. In the near future, Emily would also like to start a therapy/support group for individuals with Parkinson's Disease who are interested in maintaining their speaking abilities following individual therapy and developing a community of support amongst other individuals with Parkinson's. </p>
